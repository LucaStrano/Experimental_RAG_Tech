    "### 1. Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of a Reranker Model has become essential in most modern RAG pipelines, especially when dealing with large or complex datasets. It significantly improves the **Precision** of retrieved results by re-evaluating and reordering initial retrieved documents based on deeper semantic understanding. A Reranker Model is tipically involved in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a fast **Embedding Model** to retrieve a set of $\\text{top}_K$ candidate documents of based on query similarity. Usually, $\\text{top}_K$ is set to a relatively high number to ensure high **Recall**;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use a **Reranker Model** to re-evaluate the $\\text{top}_K$ documents and select the $top_N$ most relevant ones. $\\text{top}_N$ is usually set to a much lower number to ensure high **Precision**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder why a reranker model is necessary at all: after all, the initial retrieval step already returns a set of seemingly relevant documents. This is because embedding models, while effective for initial retrieval, rely on the **Encoder** Architecture which compresses the semantic meaning of the documents into fixed-size vectors. Relevance is then estimated using a _similarity function_ (such as cosine similarity) over the calculated vectors. While this approach is efficient, it can miss subtle semantic nuances and contextual cues of the original texts.\n",
    "Reranker Models, on the other hand, use a **Cross-Encoder** architecture, which jointly processes the query and candidate documents at the _token level_, allowing for a more fine-grained understanding of their relationship. This process, while more computationally expensive, ensures a higher quality of the final results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further enhance the quality of the results, we can also apply a **Contextual Compression** step. This step involves breaking down the retrieved documents into smaller, more manageable chunks. This allows us to not only select the most relevant documents but also to extract only the most relevant pieces from them, effectively compressing the context while retaining essential information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this pipeline is that it now requires three separate steps: An initial retrieval step, a reranking step, and a compression step. Using traditional methods, this can be inefficient and highly time-consuming. What if we could combine both Reranking and Compression into a single step? This is where the **Recursive Reranking** technique comes into play, which functions as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a fast Embedding Model to retrieve a set of $top_K$ candidate documents;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using a Reranker Model, calculate a relevance score for each sub-section of each document;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use calculated sub-section scores to both rerank documents and select only the most relevant sub-sections of each reranked document."

    "### 2.2 Implementing Recursive Reranking\n",

    "We are all set up! We can now implement the main logic of our Recursive Reranking Technique. The approach consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split each document into separate sentences, then use the Reranker Model to calculate a relevance score for each sentence with respect to the query;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each document is then given a score based on the mean of the highest $\\text{score}_N$ scores of its sentences (This is done because we could have long chunks that contain multiple non-relevant sentences, which can drag down the overall score of the document);\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select the $\\text{top}_N$ documents based on their scores;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For each selected document, we perform Contextual Compression by selecting only the most relevant sentences using a simple **Static Filter**. Specifically, for document $d$, we select all sentences whose score satisfies:\n",
    "$$\\text{score} \\geq \\mu_d + \\alpha \\cdot \\sigma_d$$\n",

    "### 3. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a diagram of the Recursive Reranking Technique [At this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucaStrano/Experimental_RAG_Tech/refs/heads/main/images/2_compress_and_rerank_diagram.png).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Recursive Reranking Technique offers a powerful way to combine both Reranking and Contextual Compression in a single pass. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with noisy chunks and high retrieval hyperparameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantages of this approach include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High efficiency, since it combines both Reranking and Contextual Compression in a single pass;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lower latency, since it avoids the need of perfoming multiple LLM calls to compress the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique works best when paired with other chunking techniques such as **Semantic Chunking** or **Proposition Chunking**. The Recursive Reranking function could also be enhanced by using a better (but more computationally intesive) Reranker Model or by considering windows of sentences instead of single sentences. This would allow for a wider understanding of the context, especially with ambiguous sentences where entities aren't directly mentioned (e.g., _The capital of Italy is rome. It is a city containing..._)."
