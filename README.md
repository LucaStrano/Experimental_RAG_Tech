# 🧪 Experimental RAG Techniques

Welcome to the **Experimental RAG Techniques** repository! This repo contains various experimental techniques for implementing and optimizing certain aspects of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. For each technique, you can find a dedicated notebook file that goes into detail about the intuition behind the technique, how to implement it, and its potential benefits.

This repostiory is adjacent to Nir Diamant's [Advanced Rag Techniques Repo](https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques), which i highly recommend checking out. 

### ⁉️ What kind of tech are we talking about?

The techniques included in this repository are **experimental** in nature, meaning they may not have been extensively tested or validated in serious production environments. However, they represent innovative approaches to improving RAG systems and could lead to advancements in the field, which is why I wanted to share them with the community. _This repository is a place for experimentation and exploration, so please approach its contents with an open mind and a willingness to test and iterate_.

> Techniques marked with a 🧪 emoji are original contributions derived from my research that, to the best of my knowledge, have not been published or widely discussed elsewhere.

### ⁉️ Can I contribute?

Absolutely! If you have a novel experimental technique that you've developed or even just thought about, please feel free to contact me. I would be happy to collaborate with you and credit you for your contribution. You can send me an email at **strano.lucass@gmail.com** or reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/strano-lucass/).
