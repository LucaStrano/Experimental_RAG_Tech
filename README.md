# 🧪 Experimental RAG Techniques

Welcome to the Experimental RAG Techniques repository! This repo contains various experimental techniques for implementing and optimizing certain aspects of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. For each technique, you can find a dedicated notebook file that goes into detail about the intuition behind the technique, how to implement it, and its potential benefits.

### ⁉️ What kind of tech are we talking about?

The techniques included in this repository are the realization of (_to the best of my knowledge_) novel ideas that I've come up with during my research on RAG and Agent systems. They are **experimental** in nature, meaning they may not have been extensively tested or validated in serious production environments. However, they represent innovative approaches to improving RAG systems and could lead to significant advancements in the field, which is why I wanted to share them with the community. These original techniques will be marked with a 🧪 emoji in the title.

### ⁉️ Can I contribute?

Absolutely! If you have a novel experimental technique that you've developed or even thought about, please feel free to contact me. I would be happy to collaborate with you and credit you for your contribution.
